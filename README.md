# CS-255-System-Analysis-Design

## **Portfolio**

### **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

In this course we worked with DriverPass as our client. They saw that so many people fail their first driving test. They want to provide their customers a system 
that offered courses, practice tests, readings, and  on the road training for them to be better prepared for their driving test.

### **What did you do particularly well?**

In this course I believe I gained a better understanding of system desgin and the thought and work that is needed to be put in to create and design a system in an efficient manner that includes every single component that the client is looking for. 
Before this course I didn't have much experience making design documents but after the course I have gained more experience diagraming systems, use cases, and functions.

### **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would go back and choose to work on the UML class diagram. I would add each method to their rightful classes. I would also add any classes that I forogt to when I had initially workde on the diagram. 
I found this type of diagram the most challenging due to everything it was able to incorporate to create a full view of the system. 

### **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

Keeping the user in mind is key to making a usable and enjoyable experience in any system for any and all types of users. When designing the system I made sure to think of how I would use and interact with each part, 
this allowed me to make sure the system is easy to understand and use for anyone no matter their experience level. 

### **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

This course has taught and showed me that the initial phase design and analyses can be overwhelming but with the right amount of focus and care it can make the rest of the development cycle easier to complete while trying to bring the clients needs to life. I tend to feel overwhelmed when starting a project but this course helped me realize that is okay and with multiple passovers of the system documents I would realize what I was missing and how I could incorporate it. Iterative design is definitelyy a method that I am going to be applying to future projects so that I don't let the size of a project get the better of me
